### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John's cows have been holding a daily online gathering on the "mooZ" video meeting platform. For fun, they have invented a simple number game to play during the meeting to keep themselves entertained.</p>

<p>Elsie has three positive integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ ($A\le B\le C$). These integers are supposed to be secret, so she will not directly reveal them to her sister Bessie. Instead, she gives Bessie seven (not necessarily distinct) integers in the range $1 \ldots 10^9$, claiming that they are $A$, $B$, $C$, $A+B$, $B+C$, $C+A$, and $A+B+C$ in some order.</p>

<p>Given a list of these seven numbers, please help Bessie determine $A$, $B$, and $C$. It can be shown that the answer is unique.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The only line of input consists of seven space-separated integers.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print $A$, $B$, and $C$ separated by spaces.</p>
